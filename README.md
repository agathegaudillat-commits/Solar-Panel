# Solar-Panel
Our client, a Swiss energy company, asked us to identify the best locations for photovoltaic panels. Using long-term sunshine data from stations across Switzerland, we analyze solar exposure to rank sites and deliver data-driven recommendations for efficient, sustainable investment.

## Description
This project develops a computational model (simulation) of a real or hypothetical system to study its behavior.  
The model is used to generate reproducible results (tables, figures, and calculations) that support a written report for our client.  

- **Motivation**: Why is this project important? What question are we answering for the client?  
- **Scope**: Briefly define the boundaries of the project (what is included/excluded).

## Requirements & Dependencies
To ensure reproducibility, all dependencies (languages, compilers, libraries, versions) must be declared.  

- **Languages used**:  
  - High-level: MATLAB  
  - Low-level: C  

- **Dependencies** (examples, replace with your own):  
  - MatLab 2025
  - GCC 12.2.0 (for compiling C code)  

You can install Python dependencies with:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
